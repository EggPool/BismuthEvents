## Current features

* Working protocol on top of bis/openfield
* basic right management (registration of event, publishing rights)
* basic cli app allowing to follow and display live event feeds
* demonstrates Bismuth dapp interaction via simple node API_ commands 

## Worked on features

* full featured right managements with several sources and ownership transfer  
* metadata for event channels (icon, mime-type, description)  

> see [events.md](events.md)

## Planned features

* Virtual database/tables and read models, see [What is event sourcing](What_is_event_sourcing.md)

## Planned apps

* Full featured GUI app

### More automation
